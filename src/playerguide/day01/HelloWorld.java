Day 1: Challenge “Hello, World!”

You open your eyes and find yourself face down on the beach of a large island, the waves crashing on the
shore not far off. A voice nearby calls out, “Hey, you! You’re finally awake!” You sit up and look around.
Somehow, opening your IDE has pulled you into the Mysterious Realms of Java (not related to the (uncopyrighted) name of a certain island in Indonesia), a strange land where
it appears that you can use Java programming to solve problems. The man comes closer, examining you.
“Are you okay? Can you speak?” Creating and running a “Hello, World!” program seems like a good way
to respond.

Objective:
    Create a program in your favorite Java IDE that prints “Hello World!” to the console, and run it.
