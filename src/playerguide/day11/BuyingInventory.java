Day 11 Challenge 1 of 2: Buying Inventory

It is time to resupply. A nearby outfitter shop has the supplies you need but is so disorganized that they
cannot sell things to you. “Can’t sell if I can’t find the price list,” Tortuga, the owner, tells you as he turns
over and attempts to go back to sleep in his reclining chair in the corner.
There’s a simple solution: use your programming powers to build something to report the prices of
various pieces of equipment, based on the user’s selection:
The following items are available:

    Rope
    Torches
    Climbing Equipment
    Clean Water
    Machete
    Canoe
    Food Supplies

What number do you want to see the price of? 2
Torches cost 15 gold.
You search around the shop and find ledgers that show the following prices for these items: Rope: 10
gold, Torches: 15 gold, Climbing Equipment: 25 gold, Clean Water: 1 gold, Machete: 20 gold, Canoe: 200
gold, Food Supplies: 1 gold.

Objectives:
Build a program that will show the menu illustrated above.
Ask the user to enter a number from the menu.
Using the information above, use a switch (either type) to show the item’s cost.
